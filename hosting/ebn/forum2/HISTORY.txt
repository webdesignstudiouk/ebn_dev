v25	26.02.13
*	Fixed iOS rotation / zooming with the help of TCB
*	Fixed appends double-encoding HTML, with thanks to Stephen Taylor
*	Fixed unable to delete corrupted posts unless signed in
	NOTE: the class `nnf_error` was added to `<article class="nnf_post nnf_op">` in "delete.html"
*	Updated to DOMTemplate v16, much better handling of HTML / XML

v24	10.01.13
*	Dynamic HTML titles (index / thread pages), the date format ('dd/mm/yyyy') and other strings that were previously
	not translatable (since v19) are now translatable. This causes a number of changes in theme configuration:
	-	These strings are now stored in `$LANG['']` (the default language) in 'theme.php' instead of, as before,
		as constants in 'theme.config.default.php', therefore it is advised that you make a new 'theme.config.php'
		file by making a copy of the updated 'theme.config.default.php' file
	-	If you've modified the 'theme.php' file at all, you should update to the new version
	-	If you've written any translations, you will need to update those with the new set of strings at the top
		of 'lang.example.php'
*	Fixed duplicate ID `nnf_post`, with thanks to Bruno Héridet
	NOTE: `<article id="nnf_post" class="...` was changed to `<article class="nnf_post ...` in "append.html",
	"delete.html" and "thread.html". No changes required in the CSS.
*	Fixed critical typo in "lang.example.php" with thanks to "gardener"
*	Pages were not working on sub-forums, with thanks to Steve Bir
*	Removed extra space that was being added around code blocks

v23	24.DEC.12
*	Duplicate appends are now ignored
*	Title lines (":: ...") within posts now link to themselves, allowing external links directly to title lines
*	Fixed mods not being able to reply to locked threads
*	Improved denying access to NNF's folders and a "cgi-bin" folder no longer shows as a sub-forum
*	`$1` no longer being stripped from code spans / blocks, with thanks to Zegnat
*	`THEME_APPEND` has been removed, `THEME_APPENDED` is a plain-text (but markup allowed) replacement.
	This is necessary to ensure that title links are always unique when appending text to a post.
	This also means that the class `nnf_appended` is gone, old appended dividers won't be styled
*	"@user" names in posts are now classed ("nnf_mod") if the user is a moderator
*	Fixed inconsistencies with 'nnf_mod' and changed class 'sticky' to 'nnf_sticky'
*	Canonical URL `<link>` added to "index.html" / "thread.html" / "markup.html" and "privacy.html"
*	Sign-in is now a button instead of a link, this mostly paves the way for future improvements
*	Page numbers now shown at the top when on portrait mobile display
*	External links now use `rel="nofollow external"`, internal links do not use `nofollow`, with thanks to Zegnat
*	Title field is now spellchecked
*	Simplified the `url` function, note that this will affect your 'theme.php', just drop the first parameter

v22	13.OCT.12
*	Posts with invalid HTML now display a message, rather than dumping PHP errors
*	RSS URL in the HTML meta was wrong and had been for some time!

v21	08.JUL.12
*	Support for running without HTAccess:
	NoNonsenseForum will now auto-detect if '.htaccess' is missing or disabled and fall back to running without,
	automatically rewriting URLs to full form. Note that to be able to use NNF without HTAccess,
	you will have to move the "users" folder to a private location, using the feature below
*	Added `FORUM_USERS` option to 'config.default.php' to set the location where the passwords are saved. you will need
	to change this option to run NoNonsense Forum without HTAccess. It can also be used to share the same users between
	multiple forums or even other compatible software
*	Added Windows 8 Metro pinned-site tile "metro-tile.default.png",
	you can override it by providing your own "metro-tile.png"
*	`METRO_COLOUR` theme option to set the Metro tile colour on Windows 8 and the pinned-site colour on Desktop IE

	-	Markup.txt removed, moved to a themed / translatable page
	-	Privacy policy added (also translatable)
	-	Translations for 'about.html' can be provided with 'about_en.html' where 'en' is the language code
	-	Page titles on index / thread / append & delete cannot be translated just yet,
		support for this will be added in a later release
*	Fixed a long-standing bug that caused page boundaries (i.e. posts per page) to be incorrectly calculated
*	Fixed incompaitbility with Windows servers involving page numbers in URLs. '+' is now used instead of ':'
*	Fixed bug with stickies not showing if no non-sticky threads exist (with thanks to "Sani")
*	Moved `theme_pageList` from 'theme.config.default.php' and into a new 'theme.php' for storing the theme functions;
	this allows each theme to use different types of lists without 'theme.config.php' having to be updated all the time
*	Page numbers are now validated / bounded
*	Current page number more visible
*	Added INSTALL.txt

*	CSS fixes for IE6/7/8, iOS and Kindle

v15	25.JAN.12
*	The greyscale theme's logo was being templated in the wrong file,
	since it's theme-specific, it has been moved to 'theme.config.default.php'
*	Added page next / previous links
	NOTE: if you have already created a 'theme.config.php' file, it is recommended to
	create a fresh copy from 'theme.config.default.php' for the above two changes
*	"User X added on date Y" text won't copy/paste so quotes can be cleaner
